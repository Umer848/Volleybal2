    <p>Footvolley is a sport that is the combination aspects of beach volleyball and association football (soccer). Footvolley sport was created in Brazil by Octavio de Moraes in 1965 on the Rio de Janeiro’s Copacabana Beach, and was first known as “pevoley” which literally means foot volley.</p>

    <h2>RULES</h2>  
    <p>Footvolley is a rebound sport played by two teams on a sand court divided by a net. The team has three hits for returning the ball (including the block touch). In Footvolley, the team winning a rally scores a point (Rally Point System). When the receiving team wins a rally, it gains a point and the right to serve. The serving player must be alternated every time this occurs.</p>
